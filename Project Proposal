INTRODUCTION
In the proposed project, we aim to develop a system that utilizes a combination of natural language processing, speech processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze emotions in live conversations. The system will be able to process real-time audio data, extract relevant features, and classify the speaker's emotional state based on those features. By providing instantaneous feedback, the system has the potential to be used in therapeutic settings, customer service departments, research laboratories, and in interactions between humans and computers that are more personalized.
MOTIVATION
In today's world, mental health concerns are on the rise, so we need tools to help detect, intervene, and support them early. This can be addressed with real-time emotion analysis, which provides immediate feedback to the individual or their caregiver. Business owners can improve customer service by understanding customer emotions in real time, and they'll be able to make better product recommendations. Additionally, emotion analysis can supplement and enhance traditional observation methods in therapeutic and research settings, offering therapists and researchers unparalleled insights into human emotional dynamics.
BACKGROUND
Emotions affect not just what we say, but also how we make decisions, remember things, and form relationships. Psychology, therapists, and human observers have traditionally been tasked with understanding and interpreting emotions. There's a growing interest in building computational models for recognizing and interpreting human emotions, especially in live conversations, thanks to advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
